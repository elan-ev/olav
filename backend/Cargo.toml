# These currently use a specific commit from the git repository. The lastest
# released version is still completely sync and based on old dependencies. To
# avoid having a difficult upgrade of the whole stack later, we already use this
# newer version, even though it's not released yet. As soon as it is released,
# we will use that release instead.
