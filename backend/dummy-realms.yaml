        **Welcome to Tobira!**

        Tobira is a video portal for [Opencast](https://opencast.org). Note that it is still
        in its *early* stages of development! Everything you see here might still change.
        Tobira is fully open source and you can find its source
        code [here](https://github.com/elan-ev/tobira).

        What you are seeing here is the most recent development build (the latest `master`)
        containing a bunch of dummy data. All text and videos you can see here are just for
        testing.
